        description: `ANT-MAN AND THE WASP : QUANTUM-MANIA. The positioning of Ant Man movies have always been close to the Avengers. The firts Ant Man movie was released after The Age of Ultron whereas, its sequel was released just after The Infinity War. This factor always gave AntMan movies an upperhand. Antman is now the synonym of the terms Quantum Realm and Time Travel in the MCU, plus we are going to see the biggest Bad Man of the Multiverse Saga, KANG THE CONQUEROR in this upcoming movie. And these factors are indicating that this is going to be the most fantastic AntMan movie ever. Together with Kang we will also see MODOK, according to sources Marvel was planning to make Zola the Modok of the MCU, but now plan seems different. Katherine Newton will be playing the role of Cassie Lang, we will also see her in an Ant Man suite as it is very clear from the poster.`,
